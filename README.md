Here is the code from my old TI calculator website: http://ti.zewaren.net/.

I'm only releasing it since many people asked me to. I don't care about it anymore.

I wrote that "code" when I was in high school and I had no idea how to program anything correctly. I was even my first PHP project.

It is soo ugly, it might be able to melt steel beams, so be careful.

You should'nt copy any of that code unless you want to make an example of what to NOT do. It's the work of a child.

I'm releasing it under the MIT licence.

Have fun.
